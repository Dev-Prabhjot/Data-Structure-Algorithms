Heap is implemented using Binary Tree
Heap uses inbuilt Library in Java PriorityQueue.
Min Heap: Min at top,pop min
Max Heap: Max at top,pop max

Algo:

Min Heap:If element Greater than minHeap.peek()         EGMin
if(arr[i]>minHeap.peek())
minHeap.poll()
minHeap.add(arr[i])

Max Heap: element Lesser than maxHeap.peek()            ELMax
if(arr[i]<maxHeap.peek())
maxHeap.poll()
maxHeap.add(arr[i])
